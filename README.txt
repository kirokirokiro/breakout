This is a Breakout game in Python made with Pygame

I'm new to Python and programming in general so the code is ugly and inefficient, but it works.

I'm doing stupid things like scaling the graphics manually, putting the sound effect in the Ball module, and putting the entire game in a Game() method. 
In 1440x900 the ball looks choppy, it looks like there's 20 FPS but there's 60...

Controls:
Left and right arrows to move
B to resize screen (switch between 800x640 and and 1440x900)
N to mute the sound effect


I'm still learning :)
